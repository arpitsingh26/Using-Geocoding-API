# Using Geocoding API:
It is a single web page that allows a user to input an address and geocode it using the Google geocoding API. It displays the address, latitude and longitude as the output.

The script for geocoding is in the file 'geocoding_script.js' inside the 'js' folder. A screenshot of a sample output is also attached with the project.
